# Explanation

The 2 main features I implemented were printing to a text file and scanning a text file. The printer only needs to accept a string + filename and print the string to a file successfully, and the scanner is expected to accept a filename and return a string with the data in the file. All of my test cases worked except for printing undefined. This breaks because I have not currently implemented a handler for undefined values. This could be fixed by using something like TypeScript which has type safety or simply had an if statement checking if the input is undefined and returning ''.
